    <div class="blog-title">Inception: Dream or Nightmare?</div>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Christopher Nolanâ€™s *Inception* would be a fantastic premise for a video game--perhaps an MMORPG for all I know about that industry. I mean, I might even play that game. However, as a movie, it's pretentious, convoluted, and completely lacking in emotional involvement. I find it frustrating to see actresses as gifted as Marion Cotillard be caught up in the hollow spectacle of endless machine gun fire and zero-gravity fist-fights.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the reason the characters repeatedly say "We have to go deeper" is Nolan's subconscious awareness that his characters, storyline, and even concept lacks depth. Remember that last dream you had? Was it straight out of Mission Impossible, or was it a strange blend of people you know, emotions you feel, and a bunch of odd, arbitrary details? As Freud postulated, people often dream about repressed, intense needs like sex, trauma, emotional yearning, or practically any other psychological unrest. A train going down a street? Maybe, but that's like a 2 out of 10 on the dream weirdness scale. *Inception* needs more *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* and *Everything Everywhere All At Once* and less *John Wick* and *The Town*</p>
      <p>By the time the top is spinning at the end, I found myself still respecting Nolan's ambition, even though he fails to make *Inception* resonate any further than a shallow, popcorn-munching action flick can resonate. In 2023,*Oppenheimer* benefited from a heightening of emotional stakes and a lack of rotating hallways.</p>

    <div class="blog-title">The Dark Knight: Cinema's Apex</div>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>At the core of Bennet Miller's excellent *Capote* is cruel irony: The same book that made Truman Capote's dreams of success, fame, and fortune come true also destroyed him. Following "In Cold Blood," the talented author never finished another book and descended into isolation, despair, and alcoholism, ultimately dying too young </p>
      <p>In this uncommontly patient, quiet, and thoughtful film, the real heavy lifting is done by the late, ingenius Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who follows the title character's relentless ambition far past the point of no return. Capote became infatuated with a murderer because his own childhood was fraught with abuse. Just like Perry Smith acted out with horrific violence, Capote acted out by manipulating and exploiting Perry for his story: "He's a gold mine" he cynically tells his friend Harper Lee, played wonderfully by Kathryn Keener. But even as Capote takes advantage, he finds himself deeply in love with his victim, which means that the execution of Perry, a necessity for Capote to finish his book, is also excruciating for him because his caring for Perry runs so deep.  </p
      <p>In the end, Capote visits the prisoners one last time, just hours before their deaths, and Capote breaks down (which was not in the script). Speaking in a director's commentary, Seymour-Hoffman reflected back on this harrowing moment in the film: "A lot of people have complicated interpretations of this moment, but for me, it was just pure, unbriddled grief, because they are going to die." The film concludes with the appropriately paradoxical statement: "More tears are shed for answered prayers than unanswered ones." Well, that would depend on the prayer.</p>
